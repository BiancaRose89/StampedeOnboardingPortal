You are a UI/UX designer and front-end developer tasked with creating a branded, self-service onboarding portal that visually matches the dark mode examples provided and uses a strong accent color (#FF0000) as the main background.

🎯 Global Styling:
The overall background color of the portal must be #FF0000

All components and typography should follow dark mode visual design, as seen in the reference screenshots

Use high contrast text, modern bold headings, glowing effect buttons, and layered UI

Use pop-out images or icons in cards or hero areas to create visual interest

🧭 Top Banner (Hero Section):
Create a dark-mode banner/header section that matches the visual language of the screenshots

It should include:

A bold heading that welcomes the user

A subheading with brief context

A background or side image or floating UI preview for visual pop

An optional call-to-action or “Start here” anchor link

Route to a dedicated content page for that area
