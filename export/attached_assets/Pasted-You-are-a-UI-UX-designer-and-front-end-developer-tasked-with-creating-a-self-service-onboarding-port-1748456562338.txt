You are a UI/UX designer and front-end developer tasked with creating a self-service onboarding portal that matches an existing partner portal's branding, layout, and user experience.

Here's what I need you to build:

1. Section: "Your Onboarding Progress"
Display a series of feature or setting blocks (e.g., “Custom Branding”, “Adding Users”, “Setting Permissions”)

Each block should be clickable, leading to a dedicated onboarding page or modal.

Dedicated onboarding pages must include:

A main embedded video

Sub-videos or step-by-step tutorials

A section for articles or in-depth guides

Optional: progress indicator (e.g., “Step 2 of 6”)

Use layout/styling that mirrors the existing partner portal (color, typography, components)

2. Section: "Master Your Platform"
Design a tab-based layout where each tab corresponds to a feature or product area

The goal is to embed or migrate content from existing external URLs into the portal interface itself

Each tab should:

Display the same information from the corresponding external URL, now fully integrated into the portal

Organize the content cleanly using accordions, cards, or split-sections for readability

You must help determine the best technical or structural way to replace the use of external links entirely

3. Section: "Knowledge Base & Resources" (BOTTOM SECTION)
This section should feel complementary but distinct from the training above

Suggest and implement a format that focuses on searchability, discovery, and utility

Example ideas:

A smart search bar with tags or filters

A “Top 5 Questions This Week” area based on trending topics

A Resource Hub with downloadable checklists, templates, or PDFs

A Community Q&A feed or integration with a support system (if applicable)

Design this to be lightweight, accessible, and engaging, with a focus on support and empowerment

Technical Requirements:
Provide front-end structure using HTML/CSS or React (preferred)

Include dummy content or placeholder data where real media will be used

Ensure responsiveness and accessibility

Minimize reliance on external links; make the experience seamless and in-portal
